# OpenGL-Dessert-Scene
Using the OpenGL, GLFW and GLM libraries, I was able to achieve the following:
- Entering the stage with the help of a presentation animation;
- Viewing the scene: scaling, translating, rotating, moving the camera with the keyboard and mouse (click + scroll);
- View the scene in solid, wireframe, polygonal and smooth modes;
- Use directional light to illuminate the entire scene, as well as a type light spotlight, to create an evening atmosphere in the desert;
- Maparea texturilor si definirea materialelor pentru un aspect cat mai placut al obiectelor»ô
- Generating shadows and a cube of light that simulates the movement of the sun along one day (I tried to make this as realistic as possible, simulating the sunset and sunrise);
- Photorealism, by introducing the effect of the sandstorm into the scene, and also by animating different objects.
